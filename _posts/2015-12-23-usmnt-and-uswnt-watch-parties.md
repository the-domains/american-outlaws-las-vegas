Your home for all AO Vegas watch parties is [McMullan's Irish Pub][0].  We recommend getting there at least 15 minutes before the match starts, unless its a World Cup related match and then you'll likely need to be there a few hours early.  Beer specials are typically on Dale's Pale Ale, but can vary from match to match.

Address: 4650 W Tropicana Ave \#110, Las Vegas, NV 89103
