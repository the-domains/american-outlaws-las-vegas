It has been announced that the USMNT will be playing Iceland as a warm up for the World Cup Qualifying matches starting next year.  The best part about this is that its only 4.5 hours away from Las Vegas so if you want to car pool its definitely possible.  

The watch party in town will be at McMullan's Irish Pub as always.  Given this is a weekend match there could be a crowd so you should plan on showing up a little early if you need a place to sit.

_**Want to go see it in person?**_

American Outlaws section tickets are available if you are a member of the club and have your dues paid up.  Those tickets are available [HERE][0].

The match is on January 31st and kicks off about 12:45pm, but let's be honest these times can vary a bit.  So show up early.  AO tickets are general admission anyways so best seats go first.

Night before parties are an AO tradition, and if you are making the trip you'll want to be there for this one.  It will be at [Q's Billiard Club and Restaurant][1] at 11835 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles CA 90025\.  Festivities will kick off at 7pm and last until whenever.  (Please don't drink and drive.  Use Uber, Lyft, or get a cab if you drink too much.)
